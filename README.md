# MIT MicroMasters in Statistics and Data Science

The **MIT MicroMasters in Statistics and Data Science** is an advanced program designed to provide learners with in-depth knowledge in probability, statistics, data analysis, and machine learning. It is ideal for professionals and students who wish to gain practical skills for tackling data-driven challenges.

This is a program I completed over the course of two years. It is recognized as equivalent to 1/4 or even 1/2 of a full Master's degree program.

Through this program, I participated in numerous hands-on classes. Once I organize the materials I studied, I will upload them here.  
Particularly for the Data Analysis course, since assignments had to be submitted in Word format, it may take me more time to compile and organize the content.
